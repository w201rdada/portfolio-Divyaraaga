## Current State (Generic retention packages).

I work for a satellite service provider organization. Around 5 to 7 % of customers call our customer support each month either to downgrade their packages or cancel their monthly subscription due to a high monthly bill. Currently our organization offers standard retention packages to those customers who call to cancel the service. For customers calling to downgrade packages, the focus is only on reducing the number of channels in the package to bring the price down. These packages are generic as there is no intelligent packaging of channels. So, the new packages may or may not be appealing to the customer.
With this solution, we want to enable our customer service representatives to offer customized retention packages instead.

## Data-driven Solution.

Our solution needs details of the customer\'s current package, viewing patterns of the customer and channel catalog data from Offers Management System. This data is used by the solution to compute the list of \"N\" most watched channels by the customer. This data will be presented to the customer service representative in a chart with a filter to control \"N\" (for e.g.: Top 5 Channels, Top 10 Channels etc.).

Based on this data the customer service representative can offer to create a package with \"N\" most watched channels, \"N\" being the customer\'s choice. The algorithm also acts as a recommendation engine by suggesting other channels which show content similar to the \"N\" channels selected by the customers. These suggestions will be presented as a list when the filter to control \"N\" in the chart is toggled by the rep.

The organization must also ensure the profitability factor while offering these packages. Therefore collaboration with business analysts and various stake holders who currently own the task of building packages is very important. The algorithm will have business rules to analyse profitability of a package, if the profit margin drops below a certain level that package will be flaged as 'infeasible' and it will be filtered out from the recommendations.

## Future State (Customized packages).

We are enabling our customer support teams to serve customers better using this data driven solution. Offering generalized retention packages to the customer will seem mechanical, whereas offering to build a customized package for the customer will help the representative to establish a better connection with the customer. Thus, the odds of retaining the customer will increase.

The limitations of the solution 

* The solution is just an enabler, the actual impact on customer retention is also dependent on the skills of Customer care representatives to market these customized packages. This limitation can be overcome by training the Customer care representatives to use the solution in their interactions with the customer.


* For a relatively new customer, the available viewing pattern data may not be enough to compute the most watched \"N\" channels accurately.

Nevertheless, this solution makes the customer retention strategy data driven and smart.
